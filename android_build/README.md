# docker_creation

Create docker images to build AOSP.
The baseDocker folder is the image contains the required packages. 
In general you needn't build this as it is prebuilt and pushed to Docker hub.

The buildDocker folder to create the image you should use to do the Android build task. After call the build_docker.sh, you will have an android-build image, which you can use to build the Android.
But it doesn't support Mac, so on Mac, either you do the build with the android_build_env image generated by the baseDocker directly (Android 6), or you can do the build with the android-build image in an Ubuntu virtual machine (Android 6 & 10).
